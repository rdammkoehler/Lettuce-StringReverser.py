# String Reverser in Python using Lettuce to Test Drive

I made this project as part of my learning process for both Python
and the lettuce testing framework. Aside from suffering some painful
lessons about how Python import works, a stellar success. 

I will be adding to the project over the next few days to experiment
with the range of features available in lettuce.
